class_name AxeAbility
extends AbilityController

## Button-triggered axe swing (test/timed-abilities branch).
## Destroys any "Tree" group body currently inside the player's
## "AxeSwingArea" node (an Area3D sibling of this node, child of Player -
## see Notes/TEST-TIMED-ABILITIES.md for the node Josh adds in-editor).
## The area's size is kept in sync with get_area_scale() whenever a stack
## is added, so it's already correctly sized by the time the button fires.
##
## Heat reward per tree (freeze-timer seconds, see control.gd's
## add_freeze_time): 1/8 of what a coffee gives. Saw-cut trees give no
## heat - only the axe (and hammer, for boulders/snow barriers) do.

## Combo system - true if a combo was already running the instant this
## swing began. When true, each tree cut during the swing reports to
## ComboController immediately (see _cut_tree()) instead of waiting for
## the deferred end-of-swing report below, so a hit landing right as the
## combo timer is about to hit 0 doesn't lose its credit to the 0.5s
## report delay. When false, the deferred report still handles it - a
## brand new combo needs the whole swing's tally to check the >=3 trees
## start threshold, which isn't known until the swing window closes.
