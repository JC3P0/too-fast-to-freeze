# Too Fast to Freeze

---

## What It Is

A 3D endless skiing game where you race downhill through trees, boulders, and snow while a freeze timer counts down. Grab coffee to add time. Don't crash.

The core loop: ski fast, survive obstacles, beat your distance.

## The Transformation

The jam version was a vertical slice made under a deadline. The goal now is to rebuild it as a proper roguelite — first getting the runner feeling great (better controls, visual polish), then layering in the roguelite systems (checkpoints, upgrades, weapons) and eventually full physics and bots.

- **Dual control systems** — new drag/angle directional controls alongside the existing turn states, switchable via the Strategy pattern. Includes a pump mechanic: release a carve at the right moment for a speed burst.
- **Slope illusion** — a curved floor mesh plus obstacles that rise on Y creates the visual feel of skiing downhill without overhauling the core movement system
- **Checkpoint upgrade system** — each checkpoint pauses the run and presents upgrade choices before you continue
- **Snow trail shader** — a GLSL/Godot shader that deforms a snow mesh as you move, leaving visible tracks
- **Bot opponents** — AI skiers that race alongside you and try to bump you into trees, navigating via A\*

## Upgrade System (Roguelite Loop)

Each checkpoint offers upgrades across three weapon/ability tracks:

| Upgrade | Level 1 | Max Level |
|---|---|---|
| **Axe** | 1 ability charge — swing to cut a tree (slight slow + swing animation, keeps speed) | More charges; faster swing recovery |
| **Jump** | Low base jump height | Progressively higher jumps |
| **Saw Blade** | Shoot one blade forward, cuts one tree | Multiple blades, wider spread, longer range |

## Architecture & Design Patterns

| System | Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Game events (hit, checkpoint, upgrade) | **Observer / EventBus** | Decouples spawner, UI, audio, bots from each other |
| Player movement | **State Machine** (existing, extended) | Already in place; extended for new states (Axe Swing, Airborne, Stunned) |
| Input controls | **Strategy** (`StateMachineStrategy` / `DirectionalStrategy`) | Two control systems coexist; swap via editor toggle |
| Weapon/ability behavior | **Strategy** | Axe and saw blade share an `IWeapon` interface; behavior is swappable at runtime |
| Obstacle/bot creation | **Factory** | `ObstacleFactory` and `BotFactory` centralize instantiation and make spawner logic clean |
| Upgrade data | **Flyweight / Data Resource** | Godot `Resource` objects hold upgrade stats; shared across instances |
| Object reuse (obstacles, projectiles) | **Object Pool** | Avoids GC pressure from constant instantiate/free during gameplay |
| Global game data | **Singleton** (existing `GlobalState`, improved) | Cleaned up to hold only true global state; split off per-system state |
| Bot pathfinding | **A*** | NavigationAgent3D or custom grid-based A\* for bot obstacle avoidance |

## Roadmap

Track progress via [GitHub Issues](../../issues).

- [x] **Phase 1** — Architecture refactor (EventBus, Factory, ObjectPool, PlayerStatsResource, GameStateManager)
- [ ] **Phase 2** — Controls + Pump (Strategy pattern — directional drag system + pump mechanic)
- [ ] **Phase 3** — Checkpoint + upgrade system (roguelite loop)
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Slope illusion (curved floor mesh + Y-rise obstacle movement)
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Axe ability + Saw blade weapon (WeaponStrategy)
- [ ] **Phase 6** — Snow trail shader
- [ ] **Phase 7** — Bot opponents + full physics (A\* navigation)
- [ ] **Phase 8** — Polish, audio, VFX, itch.io release
